  Commit-Rater is a student-project by Carsten Hartenfels (hartenfels@uni-koblenz.de) and Marco Brack (mbrack@uni-koblenz.de) in the context of the Mining Software Repositories Course in the summer semester 2015.

  Our original idea was mining Git repos and giving authors ratings based on some formal criteria for their commits. This website is a just-for-fun byproduct of our work, since we have shifted focus on finding relations between the criteria by using machine learning, but wanted to make our work publicly available.
